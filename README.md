# Music Journal

### Project Description

We share musics a lot on social media platforms like Instagram stories, to record the songs we like or to document our feelings at that moment.

I want to create a social media for people to share the music they like, comment on songs they like, record their days and lives via music, like writing a journal using music rather than words.
